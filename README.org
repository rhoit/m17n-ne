* History

  After the change in =ibus= architecture from version =1.4= to =1.5=,
  it has been difficult for alternative layout users. We were left
  with very little choice either find the replacement or freeze the
  last workable version.

  As I froze my package for last 2 years, compatibility have slowely
  started to break as the new version of the ecosystem are rolled out.
  Fed up with unexpected application =core-dump= or temination, and
  Incompatiblity with =Gtk3.IBus= force me to update =ibus= without
  the avail solution.
