#+DATE: Friday, Dec 04 2015
#+OPTIONS: num:t toc:nil
#+STARTUP: showall

Nepali input method variant for ibus-m17n.

* Getting It

** Requirements

   | *System*       | supporting ibus |
   | *Dependencies* | ibus, m17n-db   |


** Install

  #+begin_src bash
    # make install
  #+end_src

  restart the *ibus* for changes to appear.

  #+begin_src bash
    $ ibus restart
  #+end_src

* About layouts

  We provived some of the layout not offered by the *m17n-db*.
  m17n provides the handy way to add, layout see [[http://www.nongnu.org/m17n/manual-en/index.html][tutorial]].

  | Layout  | Description                                       |
  |---------+---------------------------------------------------|
  | lipi    | lipi (लिपि) is designed for programmer/localizers |
  | rom-imp | improvement with 99% backward compatibility       |


** Why ?

   - Few frequently used symbol (i.e. "~!@#$%^&*(){}<>") unavailable
     in romanized layout, resulting in constant switching, which is
     major headache for *programmers* and *localizers*.

   - Vanilla Romanized doesn't do ovious corrections.

   - Romanized layout was designed for fixed layout, where composite
     entries were not possible

** Design

   | Layout  | Control Char | phonetic | visual | vowel | remap |
   |---------+--------------+----------+--------+-------+-------|
   | lipi    |            2 |       14 |      5 |     8 |    10 |
   | rom-imp |            2 |       14 |      5 |     8 |     0 |


*** escape sequence

    Use escape sequence backward slash (=\=) for accessing default
    mapping. The all other mapping for the backward slash =\= has
    *revoked* in all layouts. e.g. for typing =/= use =\/=.

*** unicode control character

    Most of us never knew the secret of typing "न्‍न" since you always
    got "न्न". Problem was special character *Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ)*,
    which was invisible cumbersome to find!

    *NOTE*: If you see no different between "न्‍न" and "न्न" your have a
    smart renderer.

   | # | Sequence | Tokens | Result  |
   |---+----------+--------+---------|
   | 1 | /        | ्       | ्        |
   | 2 | //       | ् + ्    | ् + ZWJ  |
   | 3 | ///      | ् + ् + ् | ् + ZNWJ |


*** phonetic completion

    Most of the people have hard time remembering the sequence for
    special characters, here we provide phonetic/trasliterative
    completions. And wait, *old method still works and there few more
    too!*

    *NOTE*: If you see no different between "त्र" and "त्‌र" or "श्र" and
    "श्‌र" your have a some problem in your renderer.

    |  # | Symbol | in Romanized      | Alternatives               |
    |----+--------+-------------------+----------------------------|
    |  1 | इ      | *key*: '['        | *sequence*: 'ie'           |
    |  2 | ई      | *key*: '{'        | *sequence*: 'iee'          |
    |  3 | त्र     | *sequence*: 't/r' | *sequence*: 'traa'         |
    |  4 | क्ष     | *sequence*: 'k/z' | *sequence*: 'chyaa'        |
    |  5 | ज्ञ     | *sequence*: 'j/Y' | *sequence*: 'gyaa', 'jyaa' |
    |  6 | श्र     | *sequence*: 't/r' | *sequence*: 'shree'        |
    |  7 | द्य     | *sequence*: 'd/y' | *sequence*: dhyaa          |
    |  8 | ङ      | *key*: '<'        | *sequence*: naa            |
    |  9 | ळ      | *key*: 'L'        | *sequence*: 'lll'          |
    | 10 | ॐ      | *key*: '\'        | *sequence*: 'oom'          |

    | 12 | ॠ      | None              | *sequence*: 'riii'         |
    | 13 | ऌ      | None              | *sequence*: 'lree'         |
    | 14 | ॡ      | None              | *sequence*: 'lreee'        |


*** Visual Similar Corrections

    While writing by hand, each *glyph* is seen separately but
    *ironically* each section is character on its own, combined to
    create a new character.

    for example:

    #+begin_quote
    आ ≠ अा (अ + ा)

    ओ ≠ अो (अ + ो)

    ऐ ≠ एे (ए + े)
    #+end_quote

    But, in computers characters is represented by code, which is
    infact different even though they looks same/similar. This is why
    *spell checker* flags them, now its all *right* to make those
    mistakes. No more hunt and peak for आ, ओ, औ, ऐ.

    | # | Symbol | Sequence        |
    |---+--------+-----------------|
    | 1 | आ      | अ + ा           |
    | 2 | ओ      | अ + ो           |
    |   |        | अ +  ो          |
    |   |        | अ + ा + ो       |
    | 3 | औ      | अ +  ौ          |
    |   |        | अ +  ो +  े      |
    |   |        | अ  +  े +  ो     |
    |   |        | अ  +  ा +  ै     |
    |   |        | अ  +  ा +  े +  े |
    | 4 | ऐ      | ए + े            |
    | 5 | ॐ      | ऊ + ँ + ँ         |


*** Vowels
**** semivowel sequence
     Semivowel(diacritic) in sequence of 2 will create the independent
     vowel form.

     | # | Character | Sequence |
     |---+-----------+----------|
     | 1 | आ         | ा +  ा   |
     | 2 | इ         | ि + ि    |
     | 3 | ई         | ी + ी    |
     | 4 | उ         | ु + ु      |
     | 5 | ऊ         | ू +  ू     |
     | 6 | ए         | े + े      |
     | 7 | ऐ         | ै + ै      |
     | 8 | ओ         | ो + ो    |
     | 9 | औ         | ौ + ौ    |

**** higher vowel

     Independent vowel followed by semivowel.

     | # | Character | Sequence |
     |---+-----------+----------|
     | 1 | आ         | अ + ा    |
     | 2 | ई         | इ + ि    |
     |   |           | इ + ी    |
     | 3 | ऊ         | उ + ु     |
     |   |           | उ +  ू    |
     | 4 | ऐ         | ए + े     |
     |   |           | ए + ै     |
     | 5 | औ         | ओ + ो    |
     |   |           | ओ + ौ    |

**** Idiomatic completions

     | # | Symbol | Sequence |
     |---+--------+----------|
     | 1 | ओ      | अ +  े    |
     | 2 | औ      | अ +  ै    |
     | 3 | ङ      | ड  + ं + ं |
     | 4 | ं ं ँ         |          |

*** remap

    We have remapped some of the symbols specially in *lipi* layout.

    *NOTE*: This section is not applied for all layouts.

    |  5 | ए      | ]            | z     |          | े + े     |            |
    |  6 | ऐ      | }            |       | ए + े     | ै + ै     |            |

* Cross Map Hacks

  Since *ibus* runs =setxkbmap= in background, which alternative
  layout, is reset to *us* (qwerty).

  as they say:

  #+begin_quote
  *Go Away Or I Will Replace You With A Very Small Shell Script*
  #+end_quote

** How to install

   for now it only works for dvorak layout, see =hijack.sh= script to
   change to other layout. Here is back story of endeavor.

   #+begin_src bash
     # make hijack
   #+end_src
